# Hey there! 👋

I’m **Ayan Ahmad**, an 18-year-old BCA first-year student from India.

I’m learning coding, building my foundation in **Python**, and exploring the world of **AI & Machine Learning**.  
If something interests me, I dive into it, experiment, break it, fix it — and learn from it.

My current tech stack is simple but growing. I mainly work with **Python**, and I’m slowly expanding into  
**JavaScript**, Git/GitHub, and ML basics.  
I use tools like **VS Code, GitHub, ChatGPT, Gemini, and Jupyter Notebook** to build and learn faster.

I’ve started working on beginner projects, and I use this GitHub to document my journey, experiments, and progress.

If you want to reach out or collaborate, you can email me at:
